          Hello, I'm Bela and this site shows my projects I have with gardening, composting and soil building, as well as items that I have for sale. I was introduced to this world five years ago, when I took a Permaculture course and spent some time working on some organic farms.
          <br/><br/>
          I believe that our soils and agricultural methods hold the key to solving so much of our environmental, public, and individual health issues. How we treat our soils manifests in the nutritional quality of our food, our global climate patterns, and the health of our waterways. I work with and research soil-regenerating methods of growing food, with a focus on perennials and low-maintenance edibles.
          <br/><br/>
          Right now I am working on a food-forest project in Bradenton, Fl and selling a selection of plants that do well in a sub-tropical food forest system. These plants are especially curated for growing food in Florida and for planting in the current season they're being sold in, but can be grown in other areas and seasons, if the conditions are favorable.
